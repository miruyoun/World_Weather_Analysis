# World Weather Analysis

## Brief Overview
In this project, I developed data frames and visualizations based on users' inputs to help travelers look for potential vacation spots while looking at weather patterns around the globe. Travelers can find three folders that can assist them in planning their vacation - a weather forecast of cities around the world, a list of hotels around the globe, and potential travel route. The weather data frame was created with an API call to OpenWeatherMap and the maps were created using API calls to Google NearbyPlaces API and Google Directions API.
